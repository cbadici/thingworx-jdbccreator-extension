# thingworx-jdbccreator-extension
[Unofficial/Not supported] Extension that allows creating Database connectors based on a JDBC driver (not included)

This extension leverages the Thingworx FileRepository template to upload a third party JDBC driver file and create an “importable” extension using the uploaded file.

As a prerequisite, you need to have access to the JDBC driver for the database you want to use. The extension does not contain any JDBC drivers. 

Documentation is available in the JDBC Extensibility How To.docx
