# thingworx-jdbccreator-extension
[Unofficial/Not supported] Extension that allows creating Database connectors based on a JDBC driver (not included)

This extension leverages the Thingworx FileRepository template to upload a third party JDBC driver file and create an “importable” extension using the uploaded file.

As a prerequisite, you need to have access to the JDBC driver for the database you want to use. The extension does not contain any JDBC drivers. 

Please read the https://github.com/vrosu/thingworx-jdbccreator-extension/blob/master/JDBC%20Extensibility%20How%20To.docx guide to learn how you can connect to a JDBC-enabled system.
